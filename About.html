            Living in the colorful and historic Pondicherry, I'm not just any
            studentâ€”I'm a traveler at heart and a volleyball enthusiast who
            finds joy in both the thrill of the game and the serenity of beach
            sunsets. My life is an exciting mix of academia, explorations, and
            spiking volleyballs under the sun.

            It's where every street tells a story, every wave sings a song, and
            every game of volleyball feels like home. This place has woven its
            way into my heart, offering a backdrop of French architecture and
            the tranquility of the sea.

            While my academic journey has me diving into the depths of
            Engineering, it's the open volleyball courts and bustling streets of
            Pondicherry that truly bring out the best in me. From early morning
            classes to sunset matches on the beach, every day is an adventure.
